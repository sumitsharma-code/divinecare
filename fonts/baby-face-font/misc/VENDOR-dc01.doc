Shareware is meant for Match Software as a meaningful and sensible way of
marketing it's products. In doing so, many benefit from the generous efforts
of the company : distributors, some of whom without shareware would probably
loose a good part of their business, as well as users, who enjoy the privilege
to use and test at will quality software before buying it. Nevertheless, we
welcome any offer of new ways of distribution, publication or otherwise
profitable ventures. The main ingredient of most software products being not
plastic or paper, but creativity, we are quite sure some of our new ideas may
find in industrious hands a fortunate destiny. Please contact us, if you think 
Match Software creations can profit your business !
