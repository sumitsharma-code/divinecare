Each of these fonts is a real marvel of educational fun for a kid. Hours
of intelligent discoveries and mind exercise. Help in the development of
his mental and graphic skills.
- Dinosotype : real dinosaurs replace characters A-Z, 0-9 and a-z. Set
your application program to very large letters, and what you type
materialize as beautifully scary creatures, ready to jump on your printer
for collages, coloring, mobile creations, and so on. These pictures are
scientifically accurate, and could be used for natural science, although
a few Barney's like friends are also present.
- Mister Potato : this font is one of the most original treasures of the
chest. You first enter the face you want on the screen, Mr. Cauliflower,
Mr. Potato, Mr. Pumpkin, etc., and then add his eyes, arms, legs, hat,
etc. A ton of fun for one or several children, who will have hours of fun
creating new characters, and play with the printouts to create cardboard
figures, mobiles, or masks.
- Alphabetizer : A as Ant, B as Bear, C as Cat, the complete alphabet is
represented here, together with it's signifying words, and amazingly cute
drawings. Really attractive, and original text books can be generated
with this amazing novelty, a grand classic revisited. Great too for
letterheads, postcards, fairy books and lots of other marvelous projects
- Norman Prince : although there is a wealth of "script" fonts around,
none of them take into account the needs of young children, which is to
have an accurate representation of each character, as well as a style
closer to their calligraphic abilities. Here is a very nice script font,
resembling very well an excellent pupil's work. You may love it for
creating children's books, as well.
- Nahkt hieroglyphs : the mysteries of ancient Egypt are many, and so
fascinating for any age. One the most ancient civilizations has brought
to us one of the most interesting ways of writing, through figurative
symbols and icons. Write your name in hieroglyphs, as simply as you type
it in. Tell stories as the ancient scribes did, during the Pharaoh's era.
Enrich your history reports with exclusive notes in hieroglyphs.

languages such as FRENCH, SPANISH, ITALIAN, GERMAN, and others. They
contain also the "graphic" and scientific symbols.
